# loxone-rs

Rust implementation of the Loxoneâ„¢ communication protocol (Web Socket).

This is proof of concept software meant to showcase a very basic integration between Loxone and Apple's proprietary protocol HomeKit Accessory Protocol (HAP).
Loxone recently integrated HomeKit with version 12.2.12.1. Sadly it is only available for the Miniserver *Gen2*.

This project could evolve into a working alternative for Miniserver *Gen1* owners.
